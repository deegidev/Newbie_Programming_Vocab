<h5> "If I have learned anything as a scientist it is that one should not make things complicated when a simple explanation will do." - Ivar Giaever </h5>

<div class="text-center">
<button class='button-style' type='button' onclick="textToggle()">Okay... Let me Explain </button>

<p id="explain" style='display:none'> This document was just meant to house a few high-level definitions of common programming terms to explain things to myself while studying for an Azure Microsoft Certification Exam. Only it didn't house just a  <i>few</i> terms... It kept getting longer and longer. So I have decided to share this little labor of love to help any other newbies that may feel a little in over their heads. Sometimes you just need a quick and simple explanation to allow you to move on with whatever work needs to be done. And, full disclosure: 1. Most of the definitions relate to relational databases and cloud services, and 2.  I started this doc with a base understanding of object-oriented programming.
 <br> Hope this helps, <b>Ctrl+F</b> away! "</br></p>
