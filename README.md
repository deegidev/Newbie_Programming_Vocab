# Programming-Vocabulary-

Description: An index.HTML file created from a converted Docx file that I made as I studied and created programming projects. 
The explanations are simple, and created for those times when sometimes you need a defintion for a word in a defintion.
I added CSS edits and JavaScript onClick event to make the page more palatable for users.
